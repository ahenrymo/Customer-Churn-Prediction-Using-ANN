# Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks

![Customer Churn Prediction](insert-image-link-here)

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Based upon data of employees of a bank, we calculate whether an employee stands a chance to stay in the company or not. We explore and analyze customer data to predict churn rates, employing various data preprocessing techniques and building a neural network model for accurate predictions.

## Contents
### Data Preprocessing

1. Checking for null values: Ensuring the dataset is clean and suitable for analysis.
2. Visualizing categorical and continuous variables: Gaining insights into the data distribution and relationships.
3. Encoding categorical variables: Transforming non-numeric variables for model training.
4. Feature selection and label creation: Identifying relevant features and defining the target variable.

### Model Building

1. Splitting data into training and test sets: Preparing the dataset for training and validation.
2. Scaling the data: Normalizing features for optimal neural network performance.
3. Initializing the ANN: Setting up the foundational structure of the neural network.
4. Adding input, hidden, and output layers: Structuring the network layers for effective learning.
5. Applying batch normalization and dropout layers: Improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.

### Model Training and Evaluation

1. Compiling the model: Configuring the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
2. Fitting the model to the training set: Training the model on the dataset.
3. Evaluating model performance: Assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.
